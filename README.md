Shader Minifier
===============

Shader Minifier is a tool that minifies and obfuscates shader code
(GLSL and HLSL). Its original use-case is for the
[demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene), for optimizing
4k and 64k intros. It is also suitable for reducing the size of the
shaders in other applications (e.g. webgl, games).

The code is tested with:

* F# 4.0 on Windows (Visual Studio Community 2015)
* F# 3.0 on Linux and Mono 3.2.8
