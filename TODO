* Get a proper test suite. Seriously.

* Update to F# 3.0 (not tried, maybe it already works).

* Update to FParsec 1.0. This requires a couple of easy changes in
  parse.fs.

* Simplify the release process. Ideally, we should get a single .exe file
  that works both on Microsoft .NET and on Mono.

* Some antivirus (eg. Avast) don't like Shader Minifier. No idea why.

* Performance. I suspect that using StringBuffer in the printer would
  drastically improve performance.

* All the bug reports I've received. I should do some triaging.
